As my curiosity is great, I was always worried about how I would solve the fact that Excel has its limitations, that's how I became interested in the data analyst profession when I started doing research on how to solve this fact. As I advanced in research I saw that I had many more tools, equal or more exciting than Excel, to do different tasks. SQL, Python and Power Bi. That's how I started studying Python in a self-taught way, and how I later enrolled in the Google Data Analytics PT by Coursera course to give my study a little more order.
